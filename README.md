# -Predicting-Loan-Default-Risk-Project
Loan default is a critical issue for financial institutions as it directly affects their profitability 
and operational stability. Accurate prediction of the likelihood of loan defaults allows banks 
and lenders to minimize their risks, optimize credit offerings, and develop strategies for loan 
recovery. As financial data continues to grow in volume and complexity, leveraging advanced 
data analysis techniques becomes increasingly important. In this case study, we will explore 
how financial and demographic data can be utilized to predict loan default risk using various 
machine learning and statistical methods. 

List of Problems: 
1. Incomplete and Inconsistent Data: The dataset may have missing or inconsistent 
entries in certain columns, such as income or credit score, which can significantly affect 
the accuracy and performance of the predictive model. 
2. Imbalanced Data: The distribution of default (yes/no) may not be balanced, leading to 
a biased model that could predict the majority class (non-default) more accurately, but 
fail to identify potential defaulters. 
3. Feature Selection: Not all variables in the dataset may be equally important in 
predicting loan defaults. Identifying the most relevant features (age, income, loan term, 
etc.) that significantly impact the default risk is crucial for improving the model’s 
accuracy. 
4. Handling Categorical Variables: The dataset contains categorical variables (e.g., 
employment status, marital status, education level, loan purpose) that need to be 
appropriately encoded for use in machine learning models. 
5. Model Evaluation: After training a predictive model, it is important to evaluate its 
performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.) to 
understand its effectiveness and reliability in predicting loan defaults. 
6. Overfitting or Underfitting: The model may overfit or underfit the training data, 
leading to poor generalization to new, unseen data. It is essential to ensure that the 
model strikes a balance between bias and variance.
